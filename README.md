# **ðŸŽ® cub3D**

Welcome to **cub3D**! ðŸš€ This is an exciting graphics project where I had the chance to dive into the world of **raycasting** and recreate a **Wolfenstein3D**-like game in **C**. The project was a collaborative effort between me and a teammate. I handled the **parsing** of the game parameters and map files, ensuring all the necessary details like **valid maps** and **information** were correctly processed. Meanwhile, my mate focused on the **raycasting** magic that brings the world to life! ðŸ’»âœ¨

We built this game using **MiniLibX**, the graphical library at **42School**, to handle all of the drawing and rendering. Ready to explore a 3D world in a 2D space? Let's go! ðŸŽ®
